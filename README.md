# MoreRedoc
**Mo**deling of **Re**documented **Re**quirement **Doc**uments

MoreRedoc takes redocumented requirements and tries to generate UML class diagrams according to these requirements.
For now, SoftRedoc (written by Harry Sneed) is supported. 

In general, this tool takes two files as inputs:
* one containing the full text for each requirement, separated for each requirement
* one with keywords from the requirements, which are candidates for being domain concepts

SoftRedoc provides these two inputs. [Other tools or approaches](#support-for-other-tools) can easily be added, too. 

This software was developed for my minor thesis (*Towards an Automatic Generation of UML Models from Redocumented Textual Requirements*, supervision: Dr. Birgit Demuth, Professur f√ºr Softwartechnologie, TU Dresden). It  includes a detailed explanation of the approach and literature review of other approaches. When it's done, it will be available on GitHub, too.

# Prerequisites
- JDK 1.8

2. Build the project via
`mvn clean compile assembly:single`
3. Run the compiled jar with 
`java -jar -Xmx8G {name of the generated jar}.jar`
4. Select the respective CSVs and modeling options
5. Generate the model. Output can be found in the specified folder.

## Via IDE
For Integrating it in your IDE, just import the maven project.
